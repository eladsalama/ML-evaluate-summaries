## **About**
As part of the Machine Learning and Data Analysis workshop at Tel-Aviv Univesity, we selected a Kaggle competition and aimed to achieve state-of-the-art results. We chose the CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries competition, where the goal was to assesses the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. Our model evaluates how well a student captures the main ideas and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.  
**We acheived Kaggle bronze medal standard**, with a loss score of 0.48301, only 0.03 points behind the winners of the competition.
