As part of the machine learning and data analysis workshop at Tel-Aviv Univesity, we selected a Kaggle competition and aimed to achieve state-of-the-art results.
We chose the CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries competition, where the goal was to assesses the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. Our model evaluates how well a student captures the main ideas and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.
Our model acheived Kaggle bronze medal stardard, with a loss score of 0.48301, only 0.03 points behind the winners of the competition.
