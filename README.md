As part of our Workshop in ML, we chose a kaggle competition and strived to achive state of the art results.
The competition we chose is CommonLit - Evaluate Student Summaries, whos goal is to assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12.
We built a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.
